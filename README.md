# json-producer-consumer
Used Apache kafka (librdkafka c++) as event streamer/ message queue and simdjson for parsing json



(Note-1: Ensure that all required dependencies (Apache Kafka, librdkafka, and simdjson) are installed before executing the code)


(Note-2: Uncomment line 41 in Consumer.cpp for receiving message logs every 5 seconds (this time duration can also be changed))
